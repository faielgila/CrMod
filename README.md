A Minecraft mod made primarily in MCreator, as well as few hand-crafted parts. Visit the MCreator page here: https://mcreator.net/modification/32566/crmod-1710-and

This mod adds a lot of chemistry and chemical processing to Minecraft. Players gather minerals, crystals, and ores and process them with different chemicals to create new,
novel, and useful materials.

## Update 1.4.0 (CrMod for Minecraft 1.17)
It's the biggest update coming! Here's some of the most interesting changes in this update...
* Removes outdated items, such as the Solid Color blocks (replaced in Minecraft by concrete) and the Compressor
* Adds many minerals and crystals which can be processed into other materials. Some of those minerals include Azurite, Beryl, Carnotite, Chromite, Pyrite, and Pyrolusite.
* (Long overdue!) Adds GUIs for each machine. Experimental versions of the mod between 1.3.1 and 1.4.0 already have some of the basic GUIs.
* Removes Compressor and Compressed Blocks, since they served no further purpose.
* Streamlines and standardizes the crafting recipes for each machine, adding the Lithium Connector and Lithium-Ion Battery.
* Adds the Chemical Basin - new machine which mixes or reacts chemicals to create new chemicals.
* Adds Thorite & Thorium - more accurate replacement for Paradaxium (this also deprecates the Stablizer). Thorium can be made by chemically processing Thorite with Sodium Hydroxide, creating TSP.
Thorium is used to make the Accelerator and Thorium Cores.
* Adds 13 new chemicals, which are intermediate or side products of the FLiBe Salt chemical process. If that sounds complicated, don't worry; it'll all be in the relevant infopage or possibly a YouTube video. Some of these chemicals are Sulfur Dioxide, Vanadium Pentoxide, Anhydrite, Kyanite, and Hydrogen Gas.
